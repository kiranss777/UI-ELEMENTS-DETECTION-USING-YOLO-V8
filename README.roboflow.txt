The dataset includes 1900 images.
Components are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise
* Random shear of between -6째 to +6째 horizontally and -6째 to +6째 vertically
